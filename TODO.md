1. Use the openrouter apikey: and if using openrouter , then have an option (dropdown) to select the model in the setting  .
2. Add a playground page : For me to refine the system prompt for analysys , have a playground page where we can try the analysis of a batch submission, by changing the prompts and make it better. In this also show the responses of the ai , so it's easy to try stuff.
